Moving away from your parents and into adulthood is hard, and whether you are paying for everything yourself, or you're
getting help, learning how to spend responsibly is tough. Is that $5 Blue Chip coffee every day worth it in the end? 
How much can I be spending on the weekends with my friends? I've asked myself these questions, and my goal for
*The College Student's Piggy Bank* is to make these decisions easier with visuals, goal setting, and recommendations.
